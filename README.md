# Language-Modelling-Project---Trump-v.-Biden-Debate
Demonstration of increasingly complex language modelling tools (Bag Of Words, Ngram, TF-IDF, Word2Vec) for assessing word frequency, generating text, topic modelling and sentence structure for the first 2020 Trump/Biden debate. This repository includes the final ipynb file for this project (heavily annotated for collaboration and explainability in the final report) and the final report. *Note - we originally used the Gensim library to run Word2Vec but, as is known to happen, it started creating errors with Numpy. The final project used a Word2Vec through Pytorch to find word-vector similarity.
